# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 12- Production of ethonal in lactoccocus lactis

## Project summary (<300 words)
This project is aimed at optimizing the production of ethanol in an existing GSM of **lactoccocus lactis**. Optimization of different carbon source and flow rate revealed that the glucose repression inhibited the synthesis of ethanol. Reducing the glucose rate could potentially improve the ethanol production rate. Anaerobic or aerobic condition modification showed oxygen was not the limitation of the ethanol production. Investigation of gene regulation targets by FSEOF analysis revealed several reactions that could be either upregulated or downregulated to improve yield of ethanol.

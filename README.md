# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 12- Production of ethonal in lactoccocus lactis

## Project summary (<300 words)
This project is aimed at optimizing the production of ethanol in an existing GSM of *lactoccocus lactis*. Optimization of different carbon source and flow rate revealed that the glucose repression inhibited the synthesis of ethanol. Reducing the glucose rate could potentially improve the ethanol production rate. Anaerobic or aerobic condition modification showed oxygen was not the limitation of the ethanol production. Investigation of gene regulation targets by FSEOF analysis revealed several reactions that could be either upregulated or downregulated to improve yield of ethanol.Theory-based and OptGene algorithm strategies were applied to knock out genes related to the production of ethanol. We found knocking out genes based on theory could increase the ethanol production rate.

A summary of what we achieved in this project: 
Carbon source optimization
With/without oxygen optimization
Finding the targets of gene regulation by FSEOF analysis
Knocking out genes based on two different strategies: theory-based and OptGene algorithm 

## Project overview
Our project is organized with one folders of the pictures used in Image folder. All of our work and analysis of the GSM, carbon source, oxygen optimization, theory-based knocking out, predict regulator targets and automatic optimization including the model, are found in theâ€¯main folder. The total report and analysis lives in the Report.ipynb notebook.
